For clientapp:(Tshirt Designer )

To start app, called "clientapp" npm create vite@latest -- --template react clientapp

then, (necessary packages installation), cd clientapp, npm install three(3d threejs library) @react-three/fiber(react renderer for 3js library) 
@react-three/drei (useful addons for react three fiber ) maath(math helpers: mostly math used for three js) valtio(new package used for managing 
react state) react-color(this package is a color picker) framer-motion(package used for cool animations ) therefore, 

"npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei maath valtio react-color framer-motion "

now install tailwind: website; srch.vite and follow the instructions 
(npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer, (initialize: npx tailwindcss init -p))
(aba : "tailwind.config.js ko content ma lekha", "./src/index.css ko mathi patti pani lekha "

####(Home.jsx)Code ko further information.
Home.jsx (const snap = useSnapshot(state); //one current snapshot of that state, can use fxn
written inside state, can be used anywhere in components using this lines)

<AnimatePresence>(oc) // components of framer-motion: enables animation of components that have been removed from tree
{snap.intro && (

) }  //if we are currently on the intro page "on the hme page", in that case we can render the hme page data by(inside):

# <motion.section   className="home" {}>(oc) //simple (more precise section)div with animation attached in it. 
      //have classname 'home' and for animation we provide new obj inside curly braces. "spread (dot dot dot) slideAnimation('left')" 
      //animation kata bata?? left bata (motion section banayeu hamle precise garna (ramro snaga code lekhna ))


#motion.header(oc) //firsttime apprearing something on screen so motion header use gareko 
within motion.header, we can have a image, <img/> (img have src='./threesj.png' alt='logo' className='afai milayer lekh ')
//it ganna have slideAnimation going down <motion.header {...slideAnimation("down")}>     </motion.header></motion.section> )} ##snap.intro(closing)

//below motion header, we ganna have <motion.div>
</motion.div> //that have className="", spread (headContainer){...headContainerAnimation} 
//inside there, have another motion.div// with spread (headTextAnimation) {...headTextAnimation} 
//finally, inside there we can display h1, 

////custombutton is imported from components, we use props called "handleClick and then arrow fxn"
this ganna update the state.intro to false, finally pass some customstyles 




#######################################################
custombutton.jsx 

reder the title pass through props inside custombutton({title })
return (
    <button className={`px-2`}>
    {title}
    </button>
)
// tya vitra ko , props includes , ({type, title, customStyles, handleClick})
//we create new style property and there we can {generateStyle to which we pass (type) }
//yo generateStyle lai kaam garauna, mathi const generateStyle, arrow fxn, if lagauna parxa 


////Three js cheetsheet for importing (extra knowledge from csheet)
import * as THREE from 'three';
import React, {useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import {Canvas } from 'react-three-fiber';



#################################################
customizer.jsx

inside <AnimatePresence>
{!snap.intro &&(                                  //if not snap.intro(the homepage) &&(then)(... j hunxa tei lekhni tyo case ma)
    <></>                                   //empty react fragment
)}



###################################
(after adding some, tabs and customizing page, we goto canvas,index.jsx for 
three js use for 3d modelling and designing
using cameras,lightening, shadow etc.)


inside canvas we create many components and utilize it inside, canvas:index.jsx
by importing it.
In Canvas, we use ambientLight that have intensity
then, we use Environment, it accept preset and we use preset="city  "/>

In there we use, CameraRig (OC), inside it, Backdrop and then Center(OC),
then, in Center, it have Shirt components.

##the things won''t work goto inspect/console.
## div matrai vayo, aru property use garena vanya xa so, 
goto, Shirt.jsx and use other fxn instead of div. (three ko fxn use )



##################################
shirt.jsx

 const logoTexture = useTexture(snap.logoDecal) //this line indicates that, we use texture for the 3d model by useTexture hooks and 
 //snap.logoDecal come from (const snap = useSnapshot(store) gareko bata snap and logoDecal vanni tyo store ma use vako xa tyo lerau vaneko )
 (currently its a path pointing towords .png image)

 const fullTexture vanni arko ra same like up defined and told.


 castShadow meaning that it can cast Shadow.




 ########################
 CameraRig.jsx

 after importing necessary components, 
 within CameraRig, we are passing some childern components,(specifically the center contain the shirt, so to be able to 
 display it we have to get it from the childern (react props: astinae padheko{childern vanni react props rakehko tya })) 
 and then render it out,  we can do that by returning <group> and that group is rendering the childern.
 
 we want to modify a bit to move the camera closer, 
 for that we create a newRef called,
 const group = newRef();

 then we ganna we the ref leter on to update the state, so we can simply connect the ref on group write there like:
 return (
    <group ref={group}>{childern}</group>
    (useRef define xina vani mathi react ma define gar import from 'react' ma )
 )



   // set the model rotation smoothly.
  easing.dampE(
    
  )
  dampE vaneko fxn, we pass couple of properties to it. properties ma variable ni pass garnu paryo.

  aba properties ma x,y,z variable pass gareko,
  [state.pointer.y / 10, -state.pointer.x/5, 0] , x= state ko pointer ko y divided by 10, z= 0,
  this is ganna break it one more time, because we are ganna provide smooth time also.


***VVI*** lekheko kura lai padhna sik, tyo info ma deko kura haru 

eg. smoothTime?: number = smoothTime hunxa tesma, number form ma. likewise, delta?.(meaning the difference diyo pani lekh)
delta = difference kasari find garni? (need to hold the useFrame hooks: allow us to execute code on everyrendered frame.)
(so we can run different effects, there controls and so on.)
(useFrame accepts the callback fxn) then we can use all the easing code inside callback fxn [("here we get state,delta")=>{
    "yo vitra vaneko kya "
    
    }] "delta meaning the difference from last frame that happened"
    now we can pass delta as last parameter to easing.(tyo mathi state sangai,  delta pass gareko vayera )


        const isBreakpoint = window.innerWidth <= 1260;
    const isMobile = window.innerWidth <= 600; //this ensure we can make shirt proper size on all different scren.


    if(snap.intro) ="on homepage "
    else ="on customizer page"


        easing.damp3(
      state.camera.position, 
      targetPosition,
      0.25,
      delta
    )      //state.camera.position = one parameter, targetPosition = another parameter, 0.25 = smoothTime, delta = difference
    (yo sabbai parameter pass ho)


    ###########################camera ko dherai jasto banayo: now jumping back to improving shirt model.
    again on shirt.jsx 

    (now we work on (if we showing logo or not or the fullTexture ))
